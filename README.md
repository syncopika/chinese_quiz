# chinese_quiz
a little Chinese character quiz application with angularJS     
    
the web scraping stuff I used is currently here: https://github.com/syncopika/jsProjects/tree/master/chineseQuiz    

current goals: find out what the most commonly used characters are (up to 1000, 1500?) and try to develop a better scraper (maybe with Python?) to get those characters.
